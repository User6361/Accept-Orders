Simple void assistant written in Python

For pick-up point places 

It gets the user's phone number and searches for orders using it

All this is done using voice and interaction with the program by voice

I use simple porcupine wakeword file to speed up code for quick starting

Then goes simple 

Easy speech and phone number recognition using standard libraries

Playback of ready-made audio when matching recognition text, also taken from the website of generated voices

This is a simple project but with the possibility of modification
